 * DESCRIPTION
 * Test the WeakReference handling in a more evil way. In this test,
 * it will only keep every Xth object, thus causing more fragmentation
 * and fill the heap with unused objects. This test should not
 * throw any OOME during the test execution.
 *
 * COMMENTS
 * This test was ported from JRockit test suite.
